description: "Showcasing innovations in 3D printing technology through continuous exploration and development."
description-long: "At DeltaMaker Research, we are focused on advancing the technology behind 3D printing. Here are some of the projects we are currently working on:

	1.	Foldable Large-Format Printer: We are developing a compact, foldable design that maintains the large-format print capabilities users need, making it easier to transport without sacrificing functionality.
	2.	Quick-Change Magnetic Toolhead Mounting System: By using a kinematic coupling mechanism, weâ€™ve streamlined the process of changing toolheads, making it faster and more precise, allowing for greater flexibility in printing.
	3.	Energy-Efficient Build Surfaces: Our research is exploring build surfaces that offer excellent print adhesion without the need for heating. This approach reduces energy consumption while improving safety and reliability.
	4.	Magic Tap Touch Probe: We are developing the Magic Tap, a new touch probe designed to improve accuracy in 3D printing. This integrated nozzle-probe offers high precision to ensure consistent print quality.

DeltaMaker Research is committed to improving 3D printing technology through ongoing exploration and development. These projects are just a few examples of our work in progress."

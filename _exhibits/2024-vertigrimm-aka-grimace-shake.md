description: "VertiGrimm is the first complete overhaul of my first ever robot design, Grimace Shake!"
description-long: "Named originally for the bright purple material I built it out of, Grimace Shake was the original name for the first robot I ever designed from the ground up. After many competitions, I decided it was time for a complete makeover, and most importantly, a vertical spinner. VertiGrimm was born, and I am thrilled about it!"

  description: "Proof that you can teach an old dog new tricks. After watching the last BattleBots Championships, when Sawblaze won, and the show ended, I said out loud 'I dont want it to be over... I can do that.'. The next day, I dove into the world of combat robotics that I didnt know! The world of insect weights. In that short time, I have developed a passion for designing, building, learning, and of course, competing. I am actively working to be on the show that inspired me!"

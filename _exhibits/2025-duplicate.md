description: "A 1lb Force Night kit with an untextured look."
description-long: "It is just a Force Night kit bought from Turnabot.com and printed with PLA+. Painted or wrapped in vinyl(not sure yet) with a untextured grid pattern. It is meant to poke fun at the amount of Force Night kits in every competition.

I do not have the robot completely assembled as on now. I will update pictures once I do. The picture shown is off the Force Night Printables page."

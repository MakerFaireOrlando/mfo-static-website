description-long: "Imagine peering into a tiny world hidden within the circuits of a vintage microchip. ChipScapes take you on a journey into these microscopic landscapes, transforming the silvery-gray silicon of computer chips into vibrant, colorful works of art. Using a microscope and specialized lighting, I reveal the hidden beauty of these chips, turning the ordinary into the extraordinary.

The colors you see aren't just for show; they're the result of a unique prism effect created by the interplay of light with the intricate layers of the chip's construction. Each piece is crafted from vintage microprocessors and memory chips, mostly from the 1970s and 1980s, and each tells its own story of technological history and innovation.

Displayed in shadow boxes, on canvas, or even as framed jewelry, these artworks are more than just visual wonders—they're pieces of history, cherished by museums around the world. When I showcase these ChipScapes, I bring along a table, display grids, and a microscope, inviting you to see the magic of microchips up close and personal."

description: "Professional Artist working LIVE to show and empower others that they can make art too! "
description-long: "My name is MatthewSutton and I'm a full-time professional artist working primarily traditionally for the comic book industry. 

I thoroughly enjoyed demystifying traditional comic art and how it's made. I love drawing LIVE so people, especially kids, can see a real person making the work that often ends up published in some form. 

My goal is encourage and empower anyone that swings by my table that they can make art too and all it takes is time and practice!"

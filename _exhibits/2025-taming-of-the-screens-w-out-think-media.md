  description: "I teach digital literacy for families to learn together. Through hands-on , interactive learning, and plentiful resources for families to share together. Besides the podcast and website education I provide for free, we piloted a workshop at last May's Orlando Kids' Fringe Festival called Taming of the Screens, where I taught how to spot a troll and de-escalate a fight through scenes from Romeo & Juliet. These workshops and carnival games work best when they're in a festival atmosphere, and I created a unique game for MakerFaire that lets kids build their ideal brain and understand the effects of the internet on their development. I can run specialized workshops for the field trip day and parents/educators will leave with a literal bag of tricks."

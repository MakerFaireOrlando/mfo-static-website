description-long: "This is my vertical spinner Battle Bot for the Ant-Weight Pro bracket. It's chassis is 3D printed and made from PolyMax PLA (Super-Strong). It uses a standard Brushless motor to spin the weapon and uses DC motors for it's drive. I'm controlling it with a Fly sky Rc remote and receiver. It's pretty durable and agile on account of small size but it lacks amour on the top."

By leveraging vector design technology and plotter cutting machines, a whole new world of opportunity opens up for precision results and replication possibilities for stained glass designs. Follow us through the process of taking a stained glass design through cutting, grinding, foiling, and finally soldering."

  description: "Fandom Sophisticates - Stained Glass

I was a seller at Maker Faire last year, but if possible, I would love to do a stained glass live exhibit this year where I am actively working on creating a piece of Stained Glass during the course of the event. I would go through the process of cutting, grinding, foiling, and soldering the piece. Would need power. 

I am not sure if I would be able to sell as well at the exhibit, but if so, I would be happy to have pieces for sale like last time, or am just available as a seller if an exhibit would not be the right fit for the faire."

exhibit-id: 25-168
exhibit-zone: "Robot Ruckus (Spirit Building)"
space-number: "SA23"
description: "Explore robotic arm 3D printing: silicone suspension layers, pellet extrusion, and balloon surfaces."
description-long: "MarshRabbit Robotics is bringing a robotic arm that 3D prints in unusual ways. Instead of sticking to a flat build plate, the robot experiments with silicone printed into gel, pellets of PETG for larger parts, and even printing over balloons. The goal is to explore fun new methods of making while showing how industrial robots can be used for creative projects."

  description: "MarshRabbit Robotics experiments with industrial robots for creative fabrication. At Maker Faire Orlando, a KUKA KR6 arm will demonstrate 3D printing in unusual ways, such as extruding silicone into suspension layers or pellet extrusion with PETG. Ongoing work includes printing over balloons guided by 3D scans and depth sensors.

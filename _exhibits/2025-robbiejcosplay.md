description-long: "Robbie begin began cosplay through an interesting start. They began dancing at age 3, as they got older it was hard to find “male” costumes… so they started to design their own. At first their mother made them, but Robbie watched and learned eventually making them themselves. Robbie’s first introduction to anime was Sailor Moon in the 90’s while in high school. This lead to them making their first “cosplay” for a Halloween party. Their friends decided they wanted to do a Sailor Moon group and Robbie choice Prince Diamond. About a year or two later they attended their first conversation in New Orleans and it was like a whole new world opened up to them! Since then they continued to design and make costumes including their sisters wedding dress. With every new cosplay, Robbie tries to incorporate a new skill, technique or material they’ve never worked with before always trying to improve."

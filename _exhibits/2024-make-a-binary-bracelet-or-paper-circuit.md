description: "Learn basic concepts of a circuit (paper circuit) and binary (binary initials bracelet) "
description-long: "FIRST Robotics Team Voltage 386 will be teaching the basic concepts of a circuit through our paper circuits. These consist of a paper template, button battery, LEDs, and copper tape to make a design light up! After our students guide you through the process, you can take it home!

Additionally, we will be teaching the basic concepts of binary by using black and white beads to represent 1s and 0s. You can then translate your initials into ASCII and create a bracelet to wear around the Faire! "

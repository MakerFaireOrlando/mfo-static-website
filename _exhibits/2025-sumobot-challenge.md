description-long: "This exhibit features completely autonomous robots squaring off to wrestle each other in the sumo dohyo.  Robots must react to their opponents, attack, feign, escape and attempt to push their opponents off the edge of the platform, while avoiding the opponent from doing the same!

Each robot must meet standard requirements for size and weight.  All rules available at http://robogames.net/rules/all-sumo.php (Unified Sumo Robot Rules).  Matches a series of three rounds with a point awarded each round. Rounds are at most 1 minute each."

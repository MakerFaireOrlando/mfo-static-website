description: "This exhibits features a tiltable (TV) table with a marble maze-like Unity Game within!"
description-long: "Tilt and turn your way through this table-size digital maze powered by Unity!

This exhibit was an idea that I've wanted to make for a while, where I utilize a combination of a tilt-table, Unity game engine, and gyro sensor technology to realize a unique way to interact with a digital game that I have not experienced before. It serves as a proof of concept for larger-scale cooperative interactive designs where the physical prop is the controller."

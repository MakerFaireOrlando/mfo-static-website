description-long: "IMPAKT is a four-wheel drive beater bar robot, built and driven by Lars Elliott. IMPAKT's inaugural fights were at Hickory Bot Battles in NC in September 2023, where it took home 1st place. Lars first imagined this bot in Robot Rumble 2, and  brought it to life in Fusion 360. IMPAKT has a fighting record at National Havoc Robot League (NHRL) of 14-5 and is ranked #25. IMPAKT's body material is UHMW/TPU, it's weapon is a steel beater bar. Lars uses Repeat Robotics for his drive motors and ESCs. Known as a chaotic, knock out robot, IMPAKT's average fight times at NHRL have been 76 seconds.  
In the 1 lb antweight category, the team is bringing Impulse. Impulse's weapon is a horizonal spinner. The robot got a full redesign in the last 6 months. Impulse  recently took home first place at Battle in the 'Burg in PA. This marks Maryland-based Team Painfully Obvious' first appearance at Robot Ruckus. We're excited to be here!  "

description: "Free Noogies is a hammersaw style combat robot."
description-long: "Free Noogies is a newly designed combat robot that utilizes a spinner weapon on the end of an actuating arm. The design features a custom steel weapon and a custom 3D printed gearing reduction made to increase torque and control of the arm's movement. The robot's primary strategy is to pin opponents using its steel forks or aluminum wedge, spin up its weapon, and deliver a disabling blow to the tops of other robots, also known as a noogie. And, as the name implies, the robot is more than happy to give them out for free."

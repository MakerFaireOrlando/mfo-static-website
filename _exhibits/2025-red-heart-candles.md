description-long: "Welcome to Red Heart Candles – A Glow from the Heart

At Red Heart Candles, every flame tells a story — a story of warmth, intention, and the quiet power of slowing down. Founded by Alexandra Balda, Red Heart Candles is a deeply personal labor of love, born from a passion for meaningful rituals and the timeless beauty of candlelight.

Our candles are more than just home décor — they’re vessels of emotion, handcrafted to stir your senses and ground you in the present moment. Each candle is hand-poured in small batches with premium ingredients, clean-burning wax, and carefully curated fragrances designed to soothe, inspire, and transport.

Red Heart Candles was created out of a desire to bring more light — literally and figuratively — into the everyday. From cozy evenings curled up with a book to special celebrations with loved ones, our candles are designed to elevate your space and your spirit. We believe scent is a powerful storyteller, and our collections are crafted to reflect both nostalgic comfort and new, soulful experiences.

The name Red Heart represents everything we stand for: bold love, emotional depth, and heartfelt authenticity. The red heart is a symbol of passion and connection — a reminder to live and love with intention. We pour this philosophy into every candle we create, ensuring that when you bring one into your home, you’re not just purchasing a product — you’re inviting in warmth, care, and a spark of something truly special.

Whether you're gifting a friend, treating yourself, or curating your own sacred space, we invite you to explore our collection and find the scent that speaks to your heart.

Let every flicker from a Red Heart Candle remind you that light lives within — and it’s always worth sharing.

With gratitude,
Alexandra Balda
Founder, Red Heart Candles"

  description: "Welcome to Red Heart Candles

Founded and lovingly led by me, Alexandra Balda, Red Heart Candles is a small, heart-centered business dedicated to creating hand-poured soy and beeswax candles that inspire warmth, comfort, and connection. Nestled in our cozy little home studio, every candle is crafted with intention, care, and a deep passion for beauty and scent.

At Red Heart Candles, each creation is more than just wax and wick — it’s a sensory artistic experience, thoughtfully made to elevate your everyday moments. From the blending of fragrance oils to the final pour, every detail is handled with the kind of personal attention only a small business can offer.

We believe in the magic of ambiance — the soft flicker of candlelight, the calming effect of a well-loved scent, and the power of a quiet ritual. Our mission is to bring a bit of that magic into your home with every candle we make. Whether you're marking a special occasion or simply winding down after a long day, we want our candles to be part of those meaningful moments.

So why the name Red Heart Candles? To me, the red heart is a symbol of love, passion, and authenticity. It represents the warmth we hope to spark in your home — and the sincerity we pour into every batch. I chose this name because it reflects everything we stand for: heartfelt craftsmanship, glowing beauty, and the joy of creating something that feels like home.

When you light a Red Heart candle, you’re not just adding fragrance to your space — you’re inviting in love, light, and a little bit of soul. It’s an honor to be part of that experience.

Thank you for supporting my dream and being a part of the Red Heart family. I invite you to explore our collection and find the scent that speaks to your heart.

With love and light,
Alexandra Balda
Founder, Red Heart Candles"

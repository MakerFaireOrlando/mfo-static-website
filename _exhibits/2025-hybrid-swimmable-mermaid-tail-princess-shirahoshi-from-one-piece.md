  description: "Italia (@thegamermaid) is a member of MakerFx Orlando. She creates cosplays and fantasy costumes using soft arts, silicone molding and casting, foam smithing techniques, and sculpting with recycled materials and thermoplastics. When sheâ€™s not creating personal projects to debut at conventions and competitions, she applies her crafting skills to her occupational therapy practice: teaching pediatric age children and teens to utilize making art as a means of therapy to promote fine motor skills, executive functioning, and sensory development. 

Italia also designs costumes and fashion pieces for professional wrestlers and art exhibits across Florida. You can find her main body of work @thegamermaid or her fashion collection items on @8bitboho."

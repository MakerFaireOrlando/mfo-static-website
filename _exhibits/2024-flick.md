description-long: "We've been experimenting with Fingertech Viper kits as an accessible entry bot for families with young children trying to get into combat Although the spinner meta has been extremely successful in the answeight class, we are creating a design that can be competitive against these high-kinetic energy weapons while being significantly safer to build, test and fight. We hope that our powerful cam/spring mechanism deployed in a battle-hardened chassis with a high torque drive train will bring a new dimension to this weight class. Having been time-pressed due to two hurricanes, we’ve opted to begin developing a second (more accessible) Force Knight kit for our flipper platform but are beginning to learn to drive it as a spinner (it’s basic design) for this tournament.

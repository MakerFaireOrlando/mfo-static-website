description: "On my Exhibit, I'll will display some of my cosplay therian masks. Hope to see you there!"
description-long: "Now, I know some people might think its weird to dress up a animal, but let me tell you, its the best decision I've ever made. I mean, who wouldn't want to be a majestic creature for a day? But lets e real, its not just about the costumes, its about embracing our true selves and socializing with other people. And yes that might mean walking around on all fours, but that's just part of the fun! And let's not forget about the therapeutic benefits. I mean, who needs a therapist when you can just howl at the moon and roll around in the grass? Now, that what I call true animal therapy! So let's keep spreading therian love, one animal cosplay at a time. And in all seriousness, this is just pretend! We know we are human being, but life's too short to take ourselves seriously! Thanks for following me on this wild and furry journey, see you at the worlds greatest show and tell, Maker Faire Orlando!"

  description: "The 501st Legion, also known as Vader's Fist, is a worldwide organization of Star Wars fans who make and wear screen-accurate costumes of characters from the Star Wars universe. The organization's mission is to promote interest in Star Wars by creating and wearing costumes of Imperial stormtroopers, Sith Lords, clone troopers, bounty hunters, and other villains. The 501st Legion is often seen at Star Wars-related events and charity events like Toys for Tots and MDA Telethons. 
Albin Johnson and Tom Crews founded the 501st Legion in 1997, and it's made up entirely of volunteers. The organization has chapters in the United States and 59 other countries. The 501st Legion has forums where members can post tips and tricks, share information about current developments, and host Work in Progress posts about other members' costumes"

  description: "Fish Tank Robotics is led by Lawson Woods. Lawson is a 12 year old die hard robot guy. Since the age of 3, he has loved all things combat robotics and BattleBots. He can go head to head with the Bot Whisperer on stats of every season and team in BattleBot history and even took a pilgrimage to Vegas to watch the final weekend of taping for the last world championship. Lawson is teeming with bot design ideas and creative storytelling. Lawson is the builder and driver of Swordfish and is excited to participate in his third Rukus. His pit crew are mom and dad and big brother, Barrett. "

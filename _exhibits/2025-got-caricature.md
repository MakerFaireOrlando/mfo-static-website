description: "Sculpted pop culture caricature busts"
description-long: "On a whim I ordered some clay and paints online and just gave it a go. While the first few weren't bad I can definitely say I've gotten much better with practice. What started as a whim to add some decor to my home suddently grew when I discovered I loved to sculpt heads and paint them. ​
​
I never sought out to do replicas, I love exaggerating their facial features and putting my own spin on them. When people throw me a new or challenging character to caricature-ize I try to make it fun.

﻿My goal is to make everyone smile or even laugh a little when they see one of my sculpts in person, even the scary or bloody ones!"

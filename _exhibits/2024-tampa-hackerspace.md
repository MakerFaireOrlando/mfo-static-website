We have a vast array of tools including but not limited to: 3D Printers, Laser Cutters, 4x8 Shopbot, Metal and Wood lathes, electronics stations, cosplay, embroidery and more. Come by and check out the vast array of projects created by our makers including a 10 foot foam T-Rex that has been dressed up to mimic the balsa wood punch-outs of old! We always have something for everyone and always have a make and take for our younger (and young at heart) makers."

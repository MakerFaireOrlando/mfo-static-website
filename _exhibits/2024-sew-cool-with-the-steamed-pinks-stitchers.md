  description: "The Steamed Pinks is a fun group of fiber arts volunteers, good friends, and fun folks that currently meet up at FamiLAB Makerspace in Longwood, FL - on Wednesday Afternoons from 1:30-4:00 pm.  We work on easy sewing, serging, crocheting, loom & machine knitting, weaving, braiding, knotting, and felting projects to give, share, or sell.  We enjoy laughing and socializing while we work, and we pride ourselves on inspiring one another to try new skills and make cool new mistakes together!  100% of the proceeds from the Steamed Pinks' mentoring & fundraising auxiliary efforts go to support Fiber Arts Related Education, Makerships, Community Outreach Craft-Kit-Packing, Supplies, Tools, and Equipment/Maintenance; through our ongoing collaborations with FamiLAB.org and Helpertuntiy.org.

description: "Future-ready tech and hands-on fun from Seminole State College"
description-long: "Orlando Maker Faire Application

Seminole State College is proud to submit the following application for participation in MakerFaire Orlando.

Displays:
Rally Rocket - showcase Electric Vehicles and the college’s Automotive Engineering Technology program.  To prepare for the future of transportation, a comprehensive training program for autonomous vehicle maintenance is needed. The College’s program will equip technicians with a strong foundation in electric vehicle technology, including battery systems and high-voltage safety protocols, as most autonomous vehicles are expected to be electric.

NAO AI Robot - The NAO Robot Power V6 AI Edition is a versatile and transformative educational tool that can be used in a wide range of applications across academic, research, and outreach settings.  Students will be able to interact with the robotic platform, engage critical thinking skills and problem solving skills.

Adventure Pi - The AdventurePi portable Raspberry Pi arcade machine is an ideal candidate for inclusion in Maker Faire Orlando due to its innovative design, educational value, and alignment with the event’s maker ethos.  AdventurePi introduces hobby electronics and emulation to a broader audience, making it a great educational exhibit for students, families, and tech enthusiasts

Activities:
Reverse Egg Drop - Unlike traditional egg drop experiments, the reverse egg drop simulates a catching mechanism—tasking participants with designing a device that safely catches a falling egg. This twist introduces a new layer of complexity and realism, mimicking real-world engineering problems such as:
•	Impact absorption systems (e.g., airbags, crumple zones)
•	Material selection for safety and durability
•	Iterative design and testing under constraints
Participants must balance cost, effectiveness, and material properties, just as engineers do when designing systems for transportation, aerospace, or robotics.  Participants will be able to test their design at pre-determined “egg-drop” intervals.

Spaghetti Tower Challenge - The Spaghetti Tower Marshmallow Challenge is an outstanding activity for promoting STEM learning, teamwork, and creative problem-solving.  This challenge immerses participants in the full cycle of engineering thinking:
•	Planning: Teams strategize how to build a tall, stable structure.
•	Prototyping: They experiment with different shapes and supports.
•	Testing and Iteration: They refine their designs based on what works and what fails.

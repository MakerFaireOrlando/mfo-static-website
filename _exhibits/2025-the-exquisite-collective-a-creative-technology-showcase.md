description: "Interactivity & creativity collide in this playful celebration of imagination & technology."
description-long: "The Exquisite Collective invites you to experience three joyful, hands-on exhibits that blend technology, art, and cultural inspiration.

ðŸŽ¨ Color Me Makey â€” Bring your Makey designs to life! Our booth will feature several stations where kids can color and decorate their own Makey, and then see it brought to life through the magic of projection mapping. We want to empower kids to feel like they can make anything they set their minds too, even if it's larger than they are! In order to do that, we'll help the kids use the drawings they've made to power up and fuel our magical, interactive, projecta-makey device that turns their creations into a statue they can take a photo with!

ðŸŒ€ Estrellita - This fast-paced arcade game puts you in control of a mini Ferris wheel inspired by Latin American carnivals. Using just one lever, players must race against the clock as they load and unload passengers to keep the timer aliveâ€”balancing chaos and rhythm in a game that pulses with energy.

ðŸŒ± Ready, Set, Mow! - Hop onto a real riding lawn mower to control your in-game racer in this delightfully absurd and competitive arcade experience. Mow your way to victory and prove youâ€™re the fastest in the neighborhood!

Whether you're operating a Ferris wheel, driving a lawnmower, or bringing a character to life, thereâ€™s something for everyone at our boothâ€”a celebration of joy, imagination, and the power of making."

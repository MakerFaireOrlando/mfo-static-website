description: "The Funky Skunk by Brandon Willis is a wildly imaginative art car—a work truck mutated into art."
description-long: "The Funky Skunk is a rolling sculpture of whimsy and surprise. Built from scrap metal and recycled parts, its body mimics the classic black-and-white pattern of a skunk; but with a twist: the stripes are lined with lights so the vehicle glows at night.Its tail is mechanized to lift like a real skunk's, and it's rigged to blow bubbles out the rear.
 The vehicle is fully street-legal, outfitted with reflectors, turn signals, and conventional safety gear, and has toured events all over-including Burning Man."

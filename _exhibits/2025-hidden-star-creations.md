description-long: "Hidden Star Creations, led by maker and STEAM educator Ms. Martinez (aka The STEAM Pirate), is where storytelling and hands-on creativity collide. Guests are invited to dive into immersive, maker-focused experiences that blend art, fantasy, and personal expression.

Craft your own whimsical voodoo companion with a Make-a-Friends kit—everything you need to sew a tiny creature of your own in a take-home jar. Feel the heat with Fire Art, where you’ll use real fire to create unique-burned  designs that are safe, striking, and 100% yours.

New this year is an evolving interactive experience where visitors become part of an original fantasy series—shaping lore, making choices, and stepping into a world where their imagination writes the next chapter.

Whether you’re building, burning, or becoming part of a story, Hidden Star Creations delivers creative mischief and magical memories for makers of all ages."

  description: "Ms. Martinez, also known as The STEAM Pirate, is the maker behind Hidden Star Creations—a fusion of storytelling, art, and self-expression inspired by over a decade of teaching STEAM and animation. Her booth invites guests to explore hands-on creativity with unique experiences like Make-a-Friends, a kit where makers assemble their own whimsical voodoo companion in a jar, and Fire Art, where guests create a one-of-a-kind piece of art using real fire to burn custom designs. (we handle the fire)

New this year, Hidden Star Creations is unveiling an interactive story-based adventure where guests become part of a living fantasy world and help shape its lore. Whether you're crafting, burning, or storytelling, every experience is designed to spark imagination and leave you with something magical to take home."

description: "Leather making hobby business created on the love of the steampunk that now includes pop culture."
description-long: "This little company was started as a challenge by one of our friends that told us that a hobby can pay off with a little hard work.  A top hat was the inspiration that let us know that as long as it is in your mind, your hands can create it someday.

We have taken all of our knowledge and best practices in mind to help create objects that will be appeasing and of great quality. 

With extensive knowledge in Leather Crafting, Design and Drafting, our planning phase covers all the details so later on we know what to do and get it completed with less waste, faster. 

Our goal is to make something that you want, at a price that won't break the bank.  If the budget is limited, we make a piece in parts so that the end result will be larger, better and easier to afford and offer a payment plan also. 

We believe that not everyone can afford to buy expensive costumes at one time. Our goal is to make it so that our planning with you, will bring together smaller, less expensive pieces purchased a little at a time will end up as a complete package. So we work closely with the client to keep everything looking uniform and matching what they already have.

You the client are of the utmost importance and deserve the best quality.  Our entire team, and network of builders are committed to meeting those needs. As a result, a high percentage of our business is from repeat customers and many new referrals. 

We would welcome the opportunity to earn your trust and deliver you the best service in this growing business that builds in a simple garage."

space-number: Unassigned
description: "Test your artistic leanings and eye-hand coordination against an Arduino-based pen-plotter. "
description-long: "Remember the fun (and frustration) of twirling the knobs on an Etch-A-Sketch (tm) drawing toy?  Trying to make a reasonable pattern was really tough.  Well, with the help of an Arduino and a few servos, we've recreated the basic knob-turning drawing experience, with a few enhancements.

Stop by our exhibit and use your skills (or lack thereof) to sketch out a pen and ink drawing using our low-tech human interface.  

Take your completed drawing with you as a souvenir of your visit."

description: "Original character-driven art with  the goal of make the viewer smile."
description-long: "My work blends bold colors, playful storytelling, and just the right amount of chaos.

I create original paintings, collectible stickers, and character-driven art inspired by everything from haunted theme parks to The Four Horsemen. Each piece is a conversation, sometimes with my Boston Terrier, Finn, who’s both muse and critic.

Whether you’re into collectible art, offbeat humor, or robots riding dinosaurs, you’re in the right place.

Welcome to Randall Paints. Go, create."

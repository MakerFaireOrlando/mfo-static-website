  description: "Fish Tank Robotics has a motto: You never know what comes out of it. This team's leader, Lawson has been doing this since 4th grade and is a bit of a veteran but not really a veteran of the sport. FTR started only at Robot Ruckus with one robot, but now we are evolving. We are stronger. We are getting better. The other teams should start running...

...Fish Tank Robotics is coming."

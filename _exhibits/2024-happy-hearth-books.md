  description: "As a former High School English Teacher, I want to make sure that books get into the hands of any readers who need them. With that, paired with my passion for crafting and curating books, Happy Hearth Books was born. 
I rescue books and match them with their new homes. We curate and clean the books, wrap and match the outsides, and pair them with potential readers. I feel a book calls to you, so I am here to make that match happened. "

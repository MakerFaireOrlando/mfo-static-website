description-long: "Slam Hawg is the first robot I built and competed with. It is armed with a horizontal spinning disc and an inability to keep both wheels on the floor. Slam Hawg hasn't competed since Maker Faire 2023. 

Counterfeit sports a horizontal spinning blade, a slick paint job and it's coming to take home a bag or go home in one! No refunds. All sales are final. 

Slam Hawg and Counterfeit both compete in the 3lb beetle weight division. "

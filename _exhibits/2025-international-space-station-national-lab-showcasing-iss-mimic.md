description-long: "-International Space Station National Lab & ISS Mimic-

Discover the science and engineering behind humanity’s orbiting laboratory! ISS Mimic is a 1:100 physical model of the International Space Station that mirrors its real-time movements using live telemetry from space. The model’s solar arrays move in sync with the actual ISS, live data screens update continuously, and interactive controls let visitors explore how the station operates.

An open-source project started by space engineers, ISS Mimic now connects a global community of teachers, students, enthusiasts, and museums — empowering anyone to build their own model and engage with space exploration.

Through funding from the International Space Station National Lab, dozens of ISS Mimic kits and educational materials have been distributed to schools across the U.S., helping inspire the next generation of innovators in STEM fields and workforce development."

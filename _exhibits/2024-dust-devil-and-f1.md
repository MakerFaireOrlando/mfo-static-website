description: "Dust Devil is a drum spinner plastic ant. F1 is a triple horizontal spinner."
description-long: "Dust Devil was created only a year ago and has already competed in RCE National Championships in April 2024. Its second iteration has become more compact and has a new drum geometry.

F1 has been over a year in development. The challenges of creating a horizontal spinner with three independent spinning weapons faced a lot of design challenges, trying to balance weight, armor strength, weapon mass, and electronics. Unusually for insect weight classes, F1 requires two operators, one to drive and another to control the weapons.
To our knowledge, F1 is the first triple horizontal spinner ever made."

  description: "Tatsumaki is Japanese for Tornado (literally Dragon Spiral). We specialize in spinning weapons. We started competing summer of 2023 and attended RCE Nationals with our second bot (a Plastic Ant) Dust Devil.

Our signature bot(s) is called the F-series, a triple horizontal spinner, named after the Fujita scale for tornado strength. We currently have F1 (plastic ant). The design remains essentially the same as they go up in weight: F2 (beetle), F3 (12-lb, currently in progress), F4 (30lb), and finally F5, our heavyweight that we intend to take to BattleBots."

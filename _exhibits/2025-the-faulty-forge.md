description: "Several prop builds on tables with a banner. Aiming to inform the audience about my process."
description-long: "I aim to have several prop builds featured with descriptions of each and how the process went for each. I specialize in hard surface painting, so my setup will aim to highlight this. I will have a 3 foot pit droid that matches the one from the phantom menace, a blaster from alien romulus, various Indiana Jones props and some from Jaws. Others may come as well.

My aim is to highlight the craftsmanship and effort that goes into Hollywood level hard surface painting, as effects studios do it.

My work is 1 of 1, and I would love to share what I do to recreate the natural aging process that nature provides objects you see in reality."

  description: "The Faulty Forge is ran by me, David Vaughn. I am a self taught artist through the Stan Winston Studio School. I specialize in high quality prop replica making and hard surface painting. I aim to make museum quality pieces. Iâ€™ve made helmets, droids, swords, busts, weapons, costumes and more. 

I specialize in aging and focus on 1 of 1 pieces aimed at a high level of attention to detail.

As a hard surface painter, I recreate famous pieces from Hollywood history with my own take."

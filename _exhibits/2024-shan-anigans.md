description: "Retro watercolors and cottage-core goods with themes of spookiness, tarot, tattoos, and equity."
description-long: "Shan-anigans! has been creating retro watercolors and cottage-core home goods since 2014. Female and LGBTQ+ owned, this Orlando local likes to paint, sew, and cross-stitch all things spooky, tarot, tattoo, and equity-related. She takes custom requests and will be painting at the Shan-anigans! table all weekend long. 

Early on, my mom instilled in me a love of crafting. She learned from her mother, so I guess you could say I'm continuing a family tradition! Each item I make as if it were for one of my friends or family members. I love playing with colors and patterns so whether you're looking for a painting for your office, or a quilt for your bedroom, Shan has you covered! Made with love and an eye for detail, all items are created as if it were for one of Shan's own friends or family members."

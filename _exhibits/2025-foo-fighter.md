description-long: "Foo Fighter is a bidirectional full body spinner with the ability to strike from any direction. It is well known for it's big hits and erratic movements, often bouncing off several walls before landing the fatal blow. When struck, Foo Fighter will often take flight slamming into the upper walls and ceiling of the arena before returning to the ground. Once grounded, Foo Fighter will pick up where it left off and do it all over again."

  description: "My name is Connor, and I am 10 years old and in 5th grade. This is my first year competing in the Robot Ruckus. I love making homemade planes, parachutes, and robots. I am a member of the FLL MECObits Robotics Team 58292 and the mascot and a future member of MECO Robotics Team 8324. Robotics is my passion, and I really enjoy learning the wiring and electrical aspects of robotics. When I grow up I want to become an aerospace engineer."

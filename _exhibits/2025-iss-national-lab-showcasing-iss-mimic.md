description: "ISS Mimic is an open-source model of ISS that mimics its movements realtime from streaming telemetry"
description-long: "Draft: 
ISS Mimic is a 1:100 physical model of ISS that receives live telemetry streaming from the actual ISS and 'mimics' movements of its solar arrays, updates live data screens, and has interactive controls.  This open source project was started by space engineers and now includes a network of teachers, students, enthusiasts, and museums around the world. The intention is that students and nerds anywhere can build their own replica of ISS and be connected to space exploration!

CASIS funding provided dozens of kits and the creation of educational materials that have been deployed to schools around the US. This product aims to enhance science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and support workforce development in schools, libraries, museums, and communities."

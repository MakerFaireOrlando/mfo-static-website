  description: "In 2024, amateur radio operators from central Brevard County created the Space Coast Amateur Radio Society, Inc. to support public service and emergency communications. The group quickly became a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit public charity and registered with the State of Florida to accept donations. Since its founding, the Society has worked with Brevard County Parks and Recreation hosting youth radio activities at Spring Campouts in both 2024 and 2025, become a Weather Ready Nation Ambassador through the National Weather Service, joined Florida VOAD as the sole amateur radio affiliate, and provided all emergency operations center AUXCOMM support staff during Hurricane Milton as well as supported both the 2024 and 2025 Hurricane Exercises with the EOC.

Our mission is to serve the Central Brevard County communities by providing communication services and educational opportunities. Amateur Radio in the United States is regulated through three levels of FCC licensing: Technician, General, and Amateur Extra. Historically, the FCC established a framework whereby the Amateur Radio community administers license examinations and handles much of the related administrative paperwork submitted to the FCC."

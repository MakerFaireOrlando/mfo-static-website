  description: "I am a 21yr old college stundent majoring in biology. I am just starting my second year of competitive combat robotics after a successful first year with a trip to nationals in California. I started working with kits and modifying them but now am moving into desining my own robots from scratch and plan to sell my own kit in the near future. Before I got into combat robotics I raced competitively with rc cars where the origins of MKC Motorsports comes from. I even have a website for the team which currently includes about six active robots."

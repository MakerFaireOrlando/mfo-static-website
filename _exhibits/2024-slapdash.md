description: "A FingerTech Viper lifter kit robot with some cool modifications and plenty of customizations. 
"
description-long: "Beginning with a basic FingerTech Viper kit with a liter add-on, weâ€™ve been experimenting with ways to modify the lifter mechanism and front armor in two ways: 1) to create a powerful lifter that is flush with the front wedge (similar to the BB Whiplash), and 2) to design a powerful cam-driven flipper mechanism that can be installed with minimal modification to the basic Viper kit.

  description: " Team Hypershark is from Wellington in Palm Beach County Florida and consists of three people, Austin, Scot and Tiffany. Austin is 10 years old and is the team captain and driver. Austin loves science, he is a math whiz, he loves to read, he is a straight A student, he is a Lego robotics champion, he is a coder, he is a space geek, he wants to be a mechanical engineer and he wants to go to MIT. Scot (aka Dad) is a firefighter and helps Austin with building his robot. Tiffany (aka Mom) is a kindergarten teacher and loves to help the team any way she can.
  Team Hypershark was formed in the fall of 2023. During an episode of Battlebots Austin noticed one of the sponsors for Kraken was Palm Beach Bots and we immediately looked it up and emailed them. We saw all the different robots on the website but still were not aware of any combat robotics events other than Battlebots. Andy from Palm Beach Bots replied and suggested that we attend the upcoming Maker Faire Orlando 2023. We went to the Orlando Maker Faire where we met Andy and he explained how anyone can get involved in combat robotics. So that's exactly what we did. Austin got a Viper vertical spinner kit for Christmas in 2023 and he got 3rd place in his first event at Maker Faire Miami. We have made many upgrades and changes to the original kit and have attended a few more events throughout the year in between his Lego robotics competitions which his team placed in top 5 in the state of Florida. Austin absolutely loves competing with Hypershark and attending the events where everyone is helpful, friendly and has fun. We are thrilled about attending and competing at Maker Faire Orlando this year. "

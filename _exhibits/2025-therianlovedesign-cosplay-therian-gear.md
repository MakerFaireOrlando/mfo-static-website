description: "Magical fursuits & masks for wild souls, handmade by a soggy cat with sea-sparkle dreams."
description-long: "Welcome to TherianLoveDesign, a tide-tossed cove where magic gathers in pools and puddles, and creatures of every realm come to find their true form.

Drift through waves of handcrafted fursuits and enchanted therian masks - each one lovingly summoned by paws, stitched with starlight, and kissed by the sea. Here, tails swish with mischief, ears twitch with mystery, and masks whisper forgotten forest songs or ocean secrets. weather you're a land-bounder howler, a deep-sea dreamer, or something that dances between dimensions, you'll find a disguise that fits the wild in your soul.

Our booth is run by Kimu, a soggy little cat who's pretty sure she's part shark and 100% dedicated to make you sparkle in your own creature form. She's known to collect magical items from sea foam, puddles and very questionable treasure chests - and now she's haring them with you.

At TherianLoveDesign, we don't sell just masks and suits - we create portals. Portals to the beast inside, the dream creature waiting to be seen, or the splashy, chaotic soul that simply needs a tail and a hug.

So dip a toe in the water, or dive headfirst.
   The tide is in your favor"

  description: "Digitized microscopy is inaccessible to most user, especially in education. Having digital images is crucial for microscopy in order to communicate observation and engage in collaborations but microscope cameras are expensive, complicated, and out of reach to most users. 
By leveraging the smartphone capability most people already have and 3D printed designs, I've created a universal adapter that securely adapts the smartphone camera to the microscope or telescope eyepiece. Allowing anyone to capture their own discoveries onto their own device. "

Steampunk, Vintage inspired, 
One of a kind jewelry you can wear everyday!

My jewelry is about taking something broken and making it beautiful and new again.

	All my jewelry is one of a kind. I use parts from all kinds of places, I've spent many hours taking apart broken old grandfather clocks to get the gears also pocket watches, vacuums, old broken cameras, and of course charms - new and old.

	The materials I use are everything from brass, 925 Sterling Silver, Tibetan silver to zinc, recycled leather, all the crystals are Swarovski and I use many different gemstones, glass and wire. 

	The chains and cords are 925 sterling silver, copper, brass, bronze, black braided silk, black velvet, black leather, braided leather, waxed cotton,  ribbon and combo of materials. 

	I love to do custom orders, to remake that sentimental piece someone has been saving and doesn’t know what to do with.

	Most of my pieces will patina over time. I like to wear mine till it darkens for a while and then I polish it to a beautiful shine again.

Thanks so much and stay shiny

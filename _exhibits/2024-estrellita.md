description: "Manage a fast-paced Ferris wheel, inspired by Caribbean carnivals, with just a lever!"
description-long: "ta, inspired by the beloved carnival ride from the Dominican Republic, combines the fast-paced excitement of Crazy Taxi with the simplicity of classic arcade games. As a Dominican American, I've tapped into my roots to create an immersive experience where players control a small, speedy Ferris wheel using a single lever. Your goal is to keep time on the clock by efficiently loading and unloading passengers. Vivid lights and engaging sounds will transport you to the heart of a bustling Caribbean carnival. Ready to take on the challenge?"

description-long: "The D7 takes the power of 3D Printing and puts it on the inside, while giving you a look that is as classic as it is cool. Designed by David Tobin and printed by Zellerfeld, this shoe is as functional as it is fashionable. Mesh design allows airflow into the shoe, circulating air and giving you durable design to handle anything that comes your way. 

Bespoke fitting through custom sizing gives you a one-of-a-kind experience that keeps your feet comfortable all day long. And when you need to clean up your D7’s, just throw them in the wash with the rest of your clothes and pull them out after the spin cycle and get back to jammin’ on your day!"

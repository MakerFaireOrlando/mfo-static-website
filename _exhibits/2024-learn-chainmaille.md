description-long: "Make a chainmaille keychain!  This free 20-minute class is for anyone ages 10 and up and will introduce you to the basics of making chainmaille jewelry (yes, like the armor knights use to wear - but jewelry instead.)  You will learn to make a 1-inch keychain to keep and take home with you.  All supplies were donated by other chainmaillers to further the art form, so this class is totally free!  

A new class starts every 30 minutes but tools and seats are limited for each session - so pop by to get your name on the waiting list!  "

  description: "Learn Chainmaille!  I would like to set up side-by-side with Mischief Maille (my apprentice) and teach quickfire 20-minute chainmaille classes all day at the show.  It will be free to anyone who wants to sit down and learn to make a chainmaille keychain.  All supplies have been donated by other chainmaillers.  We will also have a display of the Chainmaille Quilt project in the space for people to see a slew of different ways chainmaille can be put together.  We will not have anything for sale at this booth - it is for educational purposes only.  "

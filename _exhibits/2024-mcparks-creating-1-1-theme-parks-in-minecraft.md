description-long: "MCParks is a Minecraft server that builds real-world theme parks like Walt Disney World, Universal Orlando Resort, Disneyland, and more to a 1:1 scale, complete with working rides, shows, and attractions. With a volunteer team of over 100 artists, builders, programmers, 3D-modelers, chat moderators, and more, we're always looking for new artistic talent to help us out!

We've recently open sourced two programming languages that our team uses to make our experiences: ShowScript for scheduling commands to run fireworks shows and attractions ( https://github.com/mcparks/showscript ), and Achievables, that we use to power gameplay features like Daily Challenges and Achievements ( https://github.com/MCParks/Achievables ). 

Working on MCParks is an excellent way to combine your love of theme parks, video games, and learning STEM skills!"

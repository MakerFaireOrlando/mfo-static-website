description: "Deadline is a Beetleweight combat robot designed entirely by me."
description-long: "Deadline is a Beetleweight (3lb) horizontal spinner combat robot. It utilizes a brushless 2814 motor & belt / pulley system to deliver power to the weapon. Everything on the bot is custom. It has a 3d printed frame made of TPU & urethane wheels I cast myself, as well as an AR600 steel weapon that weighs ~240g. (The weapon system, or spinning mass, in total is about 300g or ~2/3 of a pound). The weapon support struts & top / bottom plates were cut by my friend Zack Babcock, & the steel weapon was plasma cut courtesy of Tri City Laser inc. from NC."

description: "3d Laser Cut Wooden Art, made from new and recycled materials."
description-long: "Erin Fox grew up in a home in Maryland nearly as old as the radio. It was her parents who helped to pave the way to her discovering her passion for creating. Erin's parents renovated their house and barn to include a workshop with every toll you could imagine. They even dug out a basement and turned it into a ceramic's studio. Those experiences, and that love and passion for creating something beautiful from something forgotten or tossed aside, helped form her into who she is today and what she creates. 

Erin's business name came from what was her mother's business name. reThreads. But, now she is walking in her own style, reThreads: Foxy Style. Her husband purchased a Laser at the beginning of Covid and that was what catapulted her business making 3d Laser Cut Wooden Art. As a Mother and Wife her art helps put food on the table and pave the way for her kids to create their own dreams.

Erin is based out of Howey-in-the-Hills, Florida but can be found throughout Central Florida at various craft shows and festivals!"

description-long: "Children pick fun themes—glowing flowers, twinkling night skies, or spooky Halloween ghosts—and paint their designs on canvas. Afterward, they safely add tiny LED lights that make their artwork glow.

This hands-on activity encourages creativity, problem-solving, and a touch of STEAM learning, giving kids a real sense of accomplishment. Each child leaves with a one-of-a-kind glowing canvas they created themselves—a magical keepsake to proudly display at home."

description-long: "I mix custom blend paints that glow in the dark and paint t-shirts. The glow will not be ruined with washing. The paints are both glow in the dark and black light compatible. 

They are 100% machine washable with darks and can be put in the dryer as well.

The blanks are pre-shrunk but minimal shrinkage may occur with first wash and dry. . "

  description: "Elon and Eva are the creators of TOY FACTOR-E, an engaging hands-on experience where both kids and adults can assemble their own 3D printed toys. Their journey began a few years ago when they received their very first 3D printer and embarked on designing, printing, and constructing toys in their lab (affectionately known as Elon’s room). TOY FACTOR-E was born from their passion, allowing other children to explore the world of 3D printing, ignite their imaginations, and unleash their creativity by crafting personalized toys. "

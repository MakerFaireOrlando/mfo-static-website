  description: "Hello! I’m a passionate letterboxing hobbyist, and I would love the opportunity to host an outreach booth at the Maker Faire to introduce others to this creative and adventurous hobby.

Letterboxing combines art, exploration, and puzzle-solving—perfect for the curious, hands-on spirit of Maker Faire attendees. At my booth, I’ll provide engaging information about the hobby, live stamp carving demonstrations, and an opportunity for visitors to try carving their own stamps (for a small materials fee).

Letterboxing is a wonderful blend of creativity and discovery, and I believe it fits right in with the Maker Faire community."

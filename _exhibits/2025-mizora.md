  description: "My name is Andrew Stowell, and I'm a Mechanical Engineer at Caterpillar designing Skid Steer Loaders. I grew up watching BattleBots and building R/C cars. I built a Formula SAE race car in college, and raced a Spec Miata for a few years. After that, I got a Porsche 911 and swapped the engine for a Chevy LS3 V8. In 2022, I started competing in combat robotics. I love this hobby because it teaches you to let go of your mistakes. You don't have to build a perfect robot when you know it will get damaged. You will rebuild it better from the lessons you learned in each fight."

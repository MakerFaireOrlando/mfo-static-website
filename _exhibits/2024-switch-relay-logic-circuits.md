description-long: "A hands-on demonstration of binary logic circuits using only switches and relays. Circuits available for attendees to play with include a reconfigurable logic gate, a four-bit adder, a four-bit counter, river-crossing puzzles, and Ring the Bell, an IoT arcade machine based on the Chinese Ring Puzzle. Ring the Bell now has four levels of difficulty: players will be able to solve it by turning on four, five, six, or seven lights."

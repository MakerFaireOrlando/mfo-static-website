description: "SEA-BOT is a tiny robot made for moving scale miniatures across a repurposed LCD screen."
description-long: "Using 3D printing, electrical engineering, and coding, we have built the SEA-BOT platform: a diminutive robot for moving scale models around a layout. Combined with some video trickery, we are able to create realistic nautical scenes and dioramas that have never been seen before.

SEA-BOT is a platform that anyone can build on top of. We built it for model boats, but we want to hear what other makers would do with such a tiny robot."

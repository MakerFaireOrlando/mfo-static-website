We feature electronic parts, electrical supplies, hardware, wire and cable, test equipment, and thousands of hard to find items. Skycraft is an ideal place for the maker, hobbyists, model builders, audiophiles, artists, and the do-it-yourself electronic enthusiast.

Skycraft has even been featured in a Discovery Channel show on Satellites.  The segment showed an amateur radio group shopping for parts for a satellite, Amsat, that they later launched into orbit.

We have been in the Orlando area buying and selling since 1974.

We buy excess and surplus inventories from companies big and small and re-sell them in our hands-on, self service store located at 5021 Edgewater Drive, near Lee Road, in Orlando.

Stop in today and see what over 500 people a day shop for.

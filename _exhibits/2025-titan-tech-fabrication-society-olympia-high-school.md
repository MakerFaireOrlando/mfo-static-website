description: "Olympia HS's TTFS Club showcases innovative student projects, including 3D printing and modeling!"
description-long: "TTFS will showcase a variety of passion projects and commissions, including robots and 3D models. A slideshow featuring 3D renders and other projects not on physical display will also be running throughout the event. Additionally, we’ll have a hands-on fidget toy station and a small shop offering other fidget toys, display figures, and simple mechanical systems.

In collaboration with the Psychology Club, we’ll present an introduction to psychology through the famous Rorschach inkblot test. Visitors will have the chance to interpret student-created, 3D-printed inkblots and submit their own responses.

Our main goal is to enlighten the local community about the innovative and creative work happening at Olympia High School."

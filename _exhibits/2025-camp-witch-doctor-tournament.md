description-long: "We will host a series of battle robot tournaments throughout the weekend! Our goal is to provide a supportive and beginner-friendly option for young builders to participate in their first event. Ages 5-15 welcome (children must have parental supervision).

These short 1-2hr tournaments will take place on a predetermined schedule and are open to beginners with Camp Witch Doctor robots. Full rules and registration information are available at www.teamwitchdoctor.com/MFO

This is a great chance to get some competition experience in front of an audience! These tournaments serve as a stepping stone to Robot Ruckus at Maker Faire Orlando, with less commitment and pressure for beginners."

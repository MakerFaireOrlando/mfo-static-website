  description: "IONOX Media is an independent art studio redefining how laser technology can transform nostalgia and pop culture into tangible works of art. Founded and operated by partners Mike and Kara, the company specializes in intricately detailed, laser-cut designs, from topographic maps of iconic theme parks to one-of-a-kind pieces inspired by classic films and fictional worlds. Each design blends modern digital precision with a craftsman’s touch, showcasing how lasers can etch, cut, and layer materials to capture depth, history, and storytelling in ways traditional methods simply can’t.

What sets IONOX apart is the human element behind the laser beam. Mike’s deep-rooted passion for theme park history and cinematic lore, combined with Kara’s steady hand in production and design, fuels a business that has evolved from a garage side project to a six-figure operation with corporate commissions and devoted fans. In an era of mass production, IONOX Media proves that a small team armed with lasers, and a big imagination, can create art that’s equal parts high-tech and heartfelt."

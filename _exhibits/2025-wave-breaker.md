  description: "When we roll in, it’s a full-force forecast of chaos! Our bots hit like hurricanes, rumble like earthquakes, and leave opponents in a total meltdown. We bring the thunder, shake up the arena, and leave nothing but wreckage in our wake. The competition better take cover, because when Disaster Squad strikes, it’s no minor tremor... it’s a full-blown robotic catastrophe!"

  description: "We are the Bionic Tigers Team 1592 and we are from Cocoa High School! We are a FIRST Robotics team that competes in 2 competitions each year. We have been in FIRST for 20 years. Our group focuses on engaging students in STEM activities and teaching them how to build fast, and accurate robots. We travel to different events and demonstrate the robot to encourage others to start doing STEM. This year we have a robot from the previous season, and he throws large foam rings, great for people of all age."

  description: "Helpertunity is a volunteer-based 990N-sized 501(c)(3) charity, founded in 2010, that empowers elderly, disabled, and itinerant makers, their caregivers, and their community. The small charity collects and provides upcycled activity resources, craft supplies, and maker-training for its participants' creative and purposeful voluntainment.  Helpertunity's community-volunteers visit nursing homes and other facilities to provide crafts classes, adaptive games, and holiday festivities.  Our volunteers also pack kits for patients' independent/in-room activity.  With our year 2020-2030 focus on eco-beneficial arts, technology, and vintage carnival-style gameplay; Helpertunity has been rescuing, researching, advocating, and prototyping ways for greater resource-rescue, adaptive technology, accessible maker spaces & supplies, and eco play-scape access for all ages and abilities."

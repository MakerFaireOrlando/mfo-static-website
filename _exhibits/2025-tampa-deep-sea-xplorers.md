description-long: "Tampa Deep Sea Xplorers, Inc. is a manufacturer of small Autonomous
Underwater Vehicles (AUV) which have advanced features and are capable of diving to 600 meters depth to collect data to aid in ocean exploration and conservation. The Tampa based company produces the Barracuda AUVÂ®. It is a hand launchable AUV which serves as a stable platform to carry a wide variety of sensors including, side scan sonar, water quality sensors, acoustic modem, and others. Its patented design provides superior maneuverability which allows the vehicle to turn a full 360 degrees within its own body length.
It is fully modular and based on commercial off the shelf (COF) components. It is easy to maintain and every component can be easily removed and replaced using ordinary hand tools. The ease of maintenance and parts availability reduces downtime and mission related problems. Additionally, depending on sensor requirements as required for your mission, it is a cost effective means of meeting your needs."

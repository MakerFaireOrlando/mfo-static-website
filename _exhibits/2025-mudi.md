description: "Mudi is a beetleweight control bot."
description-long: "Mudi is designed from the ground up to be the single fastest beetleweight robot in the competition.  At its core is a suction fan that provides extra downforce, allowing Mudi to unlock the full potential of its absurdly-overpowered drive motors.  Mudi does not use wheels; instead, it sits directly on its custom-built tank-style treads with a set of skids.  This creates an airtight seal along both sides of the robot, massively increasing downforce.

Importantly, Robot Ruckus 2025 is Mudi's debut event.  It is entirely possible that everything previously mentioned will suffer a catastrophic engineering failure and fail to live up to all our boasting.  And that's okay!  We're excited to learn what our robot is truly capable of."

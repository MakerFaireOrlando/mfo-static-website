We do not publish a space plan for all outdoor exhibits, we have to validate space conditions when we are on-site at the Fairgrounds. Once you are on-site, our team will help you locate your outdoor exhibit. If you have a question about an outdoor location, email us at [makers@makerfaireorlando.com](mailto:makers@makerfaireorlando.com)

Don't know your space number? Find your exhibit on the [exhibits page](/exhibits), your space number is on that page below the exhibit description.

### Need Help?
Before the event, email us at [makers@makerfaireorlando.com](mailto:makers@makerfaireorlando.com)

During the event, if you need help please locate the crew member assigned to your exhibit zone. They will be roaming in your zone throughout the event.

# Thanks for Volunteering for {{site.event_name}} {{site.event_year}}
The event is now underway and we have closed volunteer registration. If you've already registered and have questions, please email us at <makers@makerfaireorlando.com>

### Volunteer registration typically opens in September, please check back or follow us on social media.

# We Need You!
Volunteering at {{site.event_name}} {{site.event_year}} is a great way to give back to your local community AND to attend the event without needing to buy a ticket!

Volunteers who work at least a 4 hour shift will receive free admission for the day they volunteer (if you volunteer late in the day, you are welcome to enjoy the event before your volunteer shift, and if you volunteer for setup day, you can come back for a full day on either Saturday or Sunday). Volunteers also receive a {{site.event_name}} {{site.event_year}} volunteer t-shirt.

* Community service hours are available from The Maker Effect Foundation, a 501(c)(3) public charity.
* If you have any questions about volunteering at {{site.event_name}}, or if you have a specific skill-set (especially photography/videography) not listed below, please email us at <makers@makerfaireorlando.com>

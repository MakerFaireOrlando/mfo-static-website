# Field Trip Day at Maker Faire Orlando – {{ site.edu_date_descr }}

The Maker Effect Foundation and our sponsors invite students to experience a one-of-a-kind day of hands-on learning, creativity, and innovation during our second annual Field Trip Day on Friday, {{ site.edu_date_descr }}

This special preview day is designed exclusively for public, private, and charter school field trips, homeschool students, co-ops and full-time virtual school students. Students and educators will have the chance to immerse themselves in interactive exhibits and engage directly with makers, artists, engineers, and inventors from across Florida.

Whether it’s screen printing a custom t-shirt, driving a robot or drone, or collaborating on an art project, there’s something to spark every student’s curiosity and imagination. With a focus on STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math), the day is full of enriching experiences that bring learning to life.

Field Trip Day provides a unique opportunity for students and educators to:
* Meet and interact with real-world makers and creators
* Explore innovative technologies and artistic processes
* Participate in hands-on projects designed to inspire creativity and critical thinking
* Discover potential career paths and hobbies rooted in the maker mindset

Check out the [exhibits](/exhibits/), [hands-on workshops](/exhibits/categories/hands-on-workshop/), [schedule](/schedule/) and more!

        Maker Faire is a gathering of fascinating, curious people who enjoy learning and who love sharing what they can do. From engineers to artists to scientists to crafters, Maker Faire is a venue for these “makers” to show hobbies, experiments, projects.

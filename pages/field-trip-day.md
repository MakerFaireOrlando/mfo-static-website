# Field Trip Day at Maker Faire Orlando – {{ site.edu_date_descr }}

On Friday, {{ site.edu_date_descr }}, Maker Faire Orlando invites students, teachers, and homeschool families to experience a one-of-a-kind day of hands-on learning, creativity, and innovation during our second annual Field Trip Day!

This special preview day is designed exclusively for public, private, and charter school field trips, homeschool families and co-ops. Students and educators will have the chance to immerse themselves in interactive exhibits and engage directly with makers, artists, engineers, and inventors from across Florida.

Whether it’s screen printing a custom t-shirt, driving a robot or drone, or collaborating on an art project, there’s something to spark every student’s curiosity and imagination. With a focus on STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math), the day is full of enriching experiences that bring learning to life.

Field Trip Day provides a unique opportunity for students and educators to:
* Meet and interact with real-world makers and creators
* Explore innovative technologies and artistic processes
* Participate in hands-on projects designed to inspire creativity and critical thinking
* Discover potential career paths and hobbies rooted in the maker mindset

Check out the [exhibits](/makers), [hands-on workshops](/makers?category=hands-on-workshop), [schedule](/schedule) and more!

This event takes place ahead of Maker Faire Orlando, giving school groups special access to exhibits, reduced crowds, and dedicated programming tailored to young learners and educators.

# Maker Manual

THANK YOU for exhibiting at Maker Faire Orlando! This "Maker Manual" covers many of the common questions about exhibiting at the event, and helps us all stay organized as we move hundreds of exhibits in and out of the event space!


These details should not change, however we recommend checking this page in the days leading up to the event for any small changes to timing or load-in details that may arise one our team is setting up the event on-site.


**If you have a question that isnâ€™t addressed below, please email us at <makers@makerfaireorlando.com> (or for Combat Robot competitors, email the Robot Ruckus crew at <contact@robotruckus.org>)** Please include your exhibit or team name in the email as it helps us quickly locate your exhibit.

### Anti-Harassment Policy
Maker Faire Orlando has a zero tolerance policy for harassment of any kind - Learn more: [Anti-Harassment Policy](/anti-harassment/)


## Exhibit Spaces
* Our standard exhibit space is approximately at 10'x10' space. In some locations, the building structure against walls may protrude into the space.
* By default we provide one uncovered 8' table and two folding chairs per exhibit. You are welcome to bring your own tables / chairs so you have the exact configuration you need. If you require multiple tables / more chairs for a hands-on exhibit, etc., please email us (with your exhibit name) at <makers@makerfaireorlando.com>.
* We do not pipe & drape the event. Some spaces will be against a metal building wall, other spaces will back up to another exhibit. Many makers will use inexpensive backdrop stands to hang a backdrop or banners behind them. Get creative :)
* We provide power to all interior spaces however it may not be located within your space. We strongly recommend bringing a 25' extension cord and a power strip to ensure you have what you need where you need it.
* Wi-Fi credentials are provided to selling exhibitors (who paid an exhibitor fee) by the area captain, however the Wi-Fi at the Fairgrounds can be challenging. We recommend bringing a cellular device / hotspot as a backup.
* Pop-up tents (no larger than 10'x10') are welcomed outdoors, but must be weighted to avoid wind damage. Pop-up tents may not be used inside unless the top canopy is removed, per fire code.


## Load-in & Load-out 
### Load-in Times (Changed for 2025)
* **General load-in is on Friday from 3PM to 8PM (completed by 8PM please, not arriving at 8PM). This has changed from prior years due to the addition of a Field Trip Day on Friday that limits load-in activity.** If you are exhibiting at the Field Trip Day on Friday, you will have special load-in times on Thursday. If your exhibit requires additional load-in time and you need to start before Friday at 3PM, please email us at <makers@makerfaireorlando.com>. 
* Saturday load-in is from 8AM to 9AM. Makers arriving after 8:30AM will need to park in general parking and bring their items in. Makers arriving late adds a lot of stress for the maker and for our crew. Please arrive before 8:30AM if you need to unload as the parking area becomes quite congested after this point.
* On Sunday, exhibitors can arrive at 9AM, park in general parking and all exhibits should be ready for opening at 9:45AM.

**We STRONGLY advise setup before the event day!** If something is wrong, we can likely fix it on Friday. If you donâ€™t arrive until Saturday morning, we have very limited ability to fix any issues. Friday night is also a GREAT time to meet other makers and to connect with your neighboring makers before the crowd arrives at the Maker Mixer (see below)!

If these times do not work for you and you need special arrangements, please email us at <makers@makerfaireorlando.com>

### Load-In Unloading & Parking 
On Thursday, Friday or Saturday (SATURDAY ONLY BEFORE 8:30AM), please park in general parking (the field across from the ticket area), walk over to the ticket booth area where we will have general Maker check-in and Robot Ruckus competitor check-in tents. Have your exhibitor ticket QR code scanned, receive your badge(s), THEN go get your vehicle to unload at your building. Unload, leave someone with your items, return your car to the parking lot, then go setup. We have 200+ exhibits to setup in a short period of time, and vehicles blocking lanes and loading and unloading zones slows everyone down. Please ensure you have a cart and sufficient helpers to help you with this process.

### Check in, Event Badges & Wristbands 
You will receive email before the week of the event with exhibitor tickets. You may distribute these electronically to your team who are not arriving at the same time. At check-in, ticket QR codes will be scanned and a set of credentials will be given for each ticket. (All requests for additional badges (more than 4 total badges) should be sent to <makers@makerfaireorlando.com> with the exhibit name. All requests for additional helpers must be received by Sunday, November 2nd). You are responsible for making arrangements to get tickets or credentials to your helpers.

### Maker Mixer â€“ Friday night
The Maker Mixer is from 6PM to 7PM on Friday night. This is a great time to meet other makers, grab food (we will have some light food, but note that we will not be able to meet all dietary needs, please plan accordingly), and try some of the hands-on activities. Our goal is to have our Make-a-shirt workshop open on Friday evening for the Maker Mixer so that Makers and Maker Helpers are able to make their own Maker Faire Orlando for only $10. We may have other hands-on activities open if those teams are on site Friday night and setup. Stay tuned for more info ðŸ™‚ Please note the Maker Mixer is limited to those with event (Maker / volunteer / etc.) credentials, no guests are allowed.

### Load-out
Load-out MAY NOT start until AFTER the event ends. Packing or leaving early without prior discussion and agreement may lead to your exhibit not being approved in subsequent years. All exhibits are 2 day exhibits unless youâ€™ve reached specific agreement with the event producers through the exhibit application process or by emailing <makers@makerfaireorlando.com>. Vehicles may not be moved into loading / unloading zones until after the event has ended and the crowd has left the building. **The main roadway in front of the Spirit, Opportunity, and Maker Faire Stage buildings will not open until at least 1 hour after the event has closed for safety.** We know you want to get home after a long weekend, but we ask for your patience as we safely exit the crowd.

## Maker Parking
Maker parking for the weekend will be on-site with the general parking. You may NOT park near your exhibit building. All parking for Maker Faire Orlando is FREE. Please note that in prior years we have had makers who have violated our fencing for their convenience. These fences are for everyone's security, and this action will result in ejection from the event.

## General tips
* The Fairgounds added water bottle fillers - bring a water bottle!
* Bring a cart! We DO NOT have carts available.
* Label your stuff! A roll of painters tape and sharpie markers are very useful.
* Bring more extension cords (a 25ft minimum) and power strips than you think you need.
* You are welcome to bring your own food / drinks in a small, hidden cooler.
* If you are next to a metal wall, you may hang items on the metal walls with magnets, please do not use any nature of tape or adhesive. 
* Please be patient with us. Maker Faire Orlando is a non-profit event produced by a great bunch of volunteers. Issues will happen, and we will get them resolved, but we need your patience especially during setup and Saturday morning ðŸ™‚

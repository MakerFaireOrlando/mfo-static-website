# Harness the Maker Movement in Your Classroom!

Are you interested in learning more about making in the classroom, makerspaces, or the maker movement in general? There are lots of ways we can help!

We can help you:

-   Get started in setting up your school makerspace
-   Find local makers to help with topics outside your area of expertise
-   Help you come up with great project ideas for all ages and budgets

## The Maker Effect Foundation

[The Maker Effect Foundation](https://www.themakereffect.org/) is a 501(c)3 public charity that exists to activate and amplify the efforts of makers as they learn, build and work together in their communities. As part of our mission, we produce Maker Faire Orlando, we operate MakerFX Makerspace in South Orlando and we work with educators throughout Central Florida.

## Maker Faire Orlando

[Maker Faire Orlando](https://www.makerfaireorlando.com/) is a community-organized, family-friendly celebration featuring local do-it-yourself science, art, rockets, robots, crafts, technology, music, hands-on-activities, and more. It's an event where people show what they are making and share what they are learning.

Educators (all grade levels including college / university and libraries) receive free admission to Maker Faire Orlando. If your organization is interested in sponsoring our programs for educators, please visit our [sponsor information page](/become-a-sponsor/).

To receive free educator admission to Maker Faire Orlando for you and a guest, please bring your school ID to the ticket booth at the entrance to the event where you will be given a wristband for entry. You are welcome to attend the event with your guest on both days of the event, however you will need to check-in and show ID both days. If you attend on two separate days, you may bring the same guest both days, however you may only bring a total of one guest to the event regardless of how many days you attend. Your guest may be asked to show identification. Please subscribe to our [Maker Faire Orlando Educator email newsletter](http://eepurl.com/buLkzr) (and add makers@makerfaireorlando.com to your contacts) so that you can stay informed on event information and any updates to the check-in process.

Field Trip Day on the Friday before Maker Faire Orlando allows home, charter, public, and private school field trip groups to attend for free! For more details, visit our [Field Trip Day page](/field-trip-day/).

Each year we curate (in the month before the event) a special set of Maker Faire Orlando exhibits that are targeted for educators. If you can't see everything at Maker Faire, you can use this list to prioritize! Many of these exhibits are created by educators, or these makers have indicated they are willing to help educators.

We maintain a list of local makers that are willing to do demonstrations or talks in your classrooms, help with project ideas, or provide training for educators looking to expand their skills sets and we partner with makerspaces such as [FamiLAB](https://familab.org/), and [MakerFX](https://www.makerfx.org/) as well as organizations including [Deltamaker 3D Printers](http://www.deltamaker.com/) and [The Orlando Science Center](http://osc.org/).
